Liking about Git:

I like how git stores just a few parts of our modified code , 
allowing us to save space and access previous versions.
also github , allowing users to work together .

Fav python assignment:

TBH , I loved working on all of them , because with every assignment , I was able
to find more flaws in myself and work on them , and would like more such tasks:)
